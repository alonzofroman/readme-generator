# readme-generator

## Project description 
The purpose of this project is to create a professional readme generator for open source projects.

- Using terminal or Git Bash to select the repository, execute the command 'npm install'
- Due to dependencies in package.json, inquirer should download
- Once complete, run the command 'node index.js'
- Answer all prompted questions
- Readme should be generated after all questions are answered
- Check folder for 'GenREADME.md' for your generated README
